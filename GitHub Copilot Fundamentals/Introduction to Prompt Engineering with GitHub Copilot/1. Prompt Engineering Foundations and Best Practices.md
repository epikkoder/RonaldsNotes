## What is prompt engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear instructions to guide AI systems, like GitHub Copilot, to generate context-appropriate code tailored to your project's specific needs. This ensures the code is syntactically, functionally, and contextually correct.

## Principles of prompt engineering
- **Single**: Always focus your prompt on a single, well-defined task or question. This clarity is crucial for eliciting accurate and useful responses from Copilot.
- **Specific**: Ensure that your instructions are explicit and detailed. Specificity leads to more applicable and precise code suggestions.
- **Short**: While being specific, keep prompts concise and to the point. This balance ensures clarity without overloading Copilot or complicating the interaction.
- **Surround**: Utilize descriptive filenames and keep related files open. This provides Copilot with rich context, leading to more tailored code suggestions.

## Best practices in prompt engineering
- **Provide enough clarity**: Building on the 'Single' and 'Specific' principles, always aim for explicitness in your prompts.
- **Provide enough context with details**: Enrich Copilot's understanding with context, following the 'Surround' principle. The more contextual information provided, the more fitting the generated code suggestions are.
- **Provide examples for learning**: Using examples can clarify your requirements and expectations, illustrating abstract concepts and making the prompts more tangible for Copilot.
- **Assert and iterate**: One of the keys to unlocking GitHub Copilot's full potential is the practice of iteration. Your first prompt might not always yield the perfect code, and that's perfectly okay. If the first output isn't quite what you're looking for, treat it as a step in a dialogue. Erase the suggested code, enrich your initial comment with added details and examples, and prompt Copilot again.

## How Copilot learns from your prompts
- **Zero-shot learning**: GitHub Copilot generates code without any specific examples, relying solely on its foundational training.
- **One-shot learning**: With this approach, a single example is given, aiding the model in generating a more context-aware response.
- **Few-shot learning**: In this method, Copilot is presented with several examples, which strike a balance between zero-shot unpredictability and the precision of fine-tuning.
