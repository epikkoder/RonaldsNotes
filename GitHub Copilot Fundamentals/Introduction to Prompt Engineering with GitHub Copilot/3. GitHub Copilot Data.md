## Data handling for GitHub Copilot code suggestions
GitHub Copilot in the code editor does not retain any prompts like code or other context used for the purposes of providing suggestions to train the foundational models. It discards the prompts once a suggestion is returned.

## Data handling for GitHub Copilot chat
- **Formatting**: Copilot meticulously formats the generated response for optimal presentation within the chat interface. It highlights code snippets to improve readability and may include options for direct integration into your code. Copilot showcases the formatted response in the Copilot Chat window within the IDE, allowing you to easily review and interact with the provided information.
- **User engagement**: You can actively engage with the response by asking follow-up questions, requesting clarifications, or providing additional input. The chat interface maintains a conversation history to facilitate contextual understanding in subsequent interactions.
- **Data retention**: For Copilot Chat used outside the code editor, GitHub typically retains prompts, suggestions, and supporting context for 28 days. Specific retention policies for Copilot Chat within the code editor may vary.

## Prompt types supported by GitHub Copilot Chat
- **Direct Questions**: You can ask specific questions about coding concepts, libraries, or troubleshooting issues.
- **Code-Related Requests**: You can request code generation, modification, or explanation. 
- **Open-Ended Queries**: You can explore coding concepts or seek general guidance by asking open-ended questions.
- **Contextual Prompts**: You can provide code snippets or describe specific coding scenarios to seek tailored assistance.

## Limited context windows
GitHub Copilot's context window typically ranges from approximately 200-500 lines of code or up to a few thousand tokens. This limitation can vary depending on the specific implementation and version of Copilot being used.

Copilot Chat currently operates with a context window of 4k tokens, providing a broader scope for understanding and responding to user queries compared to the standard Copilot.
