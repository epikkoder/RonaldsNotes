Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence models designed and trained to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.

Here are some core aspects to understand about LLMs:
- **Volume of training data**
- **Contextual understanding**
- **Machine learning and AI integration**
- **Versatility**

## Role of LLMs in GitHub Copilot and prompting
- **Fine-tuning LLMs**
  - Fine-tuning is a critical process that allows us to tailor pretrained large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks or domains.
- **LoRA fine-tuning**
  - (Low-Rank Adaptation)
  - LoRA adds smaller trainable parts to each layer of the pretrained model, instead of changing everything.
  - The original model remains the same, which saves time and resources.
  - It beats other adaptation methods like adapters and prefix-tuning.
  - It's like getting great results with fewer moving parts.
