Critical thinking is the ability to identify arguments and assess their strengths and weaknesses, while being aware of your and others' biases and taking into account the context of the reasoning.

Several key components:
1. Identifying arguments. This means recognizing when someone is making a claim and providing reasons or evidence to support that claim.
2. Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of those arguments. This involves evaluating how well the reasons or evidence actually support the claim, looking for flaws in the reasoning, and considering counterarguments.
3. Being aware of biases, both your own and others'. We all have biases that can influence our thinking, often unconsciously. Part of critical thinking is trying to identify and account for these biases.
4. Considering the context of the reasoning. Arguments don't happen in a vacuum - there's always a broader context of background assumptions, intended audience, speaker's motives, etc. Critical thinking means taking this context into account when evaluating arguments.

The point of critical thinking is to bring as much of it as possible to the surface, in some sense slowing the reasoning process down, making it explicit and deliberate. Unless you understand the factors that allow your brain to fool itself when you're trying to think critically, you can still find critical thinking very challenging, even if you learn a lot about critical thinking techniques.
