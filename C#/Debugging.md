In Visual Studio, pressing `F10` to debug stops to the very first line of code that runs.

Pressing `Ctrl + F10` does "Run to cursor", where the app runs and stops at the line of code where you did the command.

You can drag the arrow up the code where it's currently stopped to run the previous code. (You need to be careful when doing this, as "this may have unintended consequences.")
